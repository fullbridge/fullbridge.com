Jenna Tramonti is a Production Assistant on the Program Development Bootcamp Team. Her primary role is to proofread and upload instructional content for core Fullbridge Programs. She graduated Wheaton College (MA) with an English degree, so she also dabbles in writing for Program Dev whenever she can. In between frantically uploading content to the Fullbridge Platform, she enjoys tap-dancing and writing film/TV reviews on her blog.
