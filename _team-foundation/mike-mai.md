Mike Mai is a full-stack designer who doesn&rsquo;t use *Photoshop*, instead he writes in *Sublime Text*. Since graduating from *MassArt* in '09, he&rsquo;s been designing websites and complex online platforms&mdash;*Bluetrain Mobile*, *Sonicbids* and *BIDMC PatientSite*&mdash;focusing heavily on user experience. He spends majority of his time solving problems. That&rsquo;s what design is all about.

For fun, he runs a CMYK inspiration blog and works on web typography projects such as *Typesettings.css*.
