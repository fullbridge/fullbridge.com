  Mike Mai is a full-stack designer who doesn&rsquo;t use <em>Photoshop</em>, instead he writes in <em>Sublime Text</em>. Since graduating from <em>MassArt</em> in '09, he&rsquo;s been designing websites and complex online platforms&mdash;<em>Bluetrain Mobile</em>, <em>Sonicbids</em> and <em>BIDMC PatientSite</em>&mdash;focusing heavily on user experience. He spends majority of his time solving problems. That&rsquo;s what design is all about.
