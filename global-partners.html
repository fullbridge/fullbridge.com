              People learn from people. Lyra Learning Labs and Working Labs can be facilitated by in-house leadership with our training and preparation, or by one of our specialist coaches. Fullbridge coaches are world-class leaders who model professional behavior, share their experiences and feedback, and help participants navigate the challenges they encounter in learning and working labs.
