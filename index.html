            To compete today, organizations must tear down the notion of traditional learning and instead promote agility, idea flow and innovation. At Fullbridge, we believe smart learning is iterative and the influence of teams and social networks is very real. That's why we built Lyra.

                Our Fullbridge hire made an impact immediately. A lot of recent grads come out ingrained in school life, focused on working individually to get good grades. A mind-shift needs to occur to be successful in the workforce. His mindset was better prepared and had that shift coming in. He had self-awareness, awareness of others, and great teamwork.
