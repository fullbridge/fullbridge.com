                Our Fullbridge hire made an impact immediately. A lot of recent grads come out ingrained in school life, focused on working individually to get good grades. A mind-shift needs to occur to be successful in the workforce. His mindset was better prepared and had that shift coming in. He had self-awareness, awareness of others, and great teamwork.
