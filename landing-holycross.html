              To complement the Holy Cross rigorous education, you will be immersed in business, finance, marketing, and innovation—the skills employers seek. Working closely in teams to tackle real-world projects, you will develop a strong core of work competencies, and develop confidence to take your next step. In addition, your own personal Fullbridge coach will be your guide and mentor throughout the program.

              Classrooms will be transformed into a simulated workplace—the program is an intensive lecture-free hands-on experience that culminates in a final team presentation.
