                    Hierarchical organizational models aren’t just being turned upside down—they’re being deconstructed from the inside out. Businesses are reinventing themselves to operate as networks of teams to keep pace with the challenges of a fluid, unpredictable world.

            Fullbridge learning experiences are powered by our proprietary Lyra Technology.  Lyra is the first and only learning system to incorporate a new science of experiential learning&mdash;a unique high-tech, high-touch approach that puts individuals and teams into measurable problem solving experiences to find competency gaps.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lyra is a knowledge technology hub that processes multiple layers of data on underlying competencies to give participants a rich picture of their performance and a better understanding of how to develop self-awareness, knowledge, skills, and strategies that drive daily problem solving and innovation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lyra captures data from wearable devices, peer, self and expert assessments, and creates effective personalized learning from an ever expanding hub of educational content.

                An MIT study found that by simply measuring human signals such as fluidity, confidence, and tone (without listening to any content of what was being said) they could accurately predict which plans executives would select in a business plan contest, and what dates women would choose in a speed dating exercise.

              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Companies:</strong> Don’t lose opportunities to solve important problems and find new innovative solutions because the best ideas get lost in the clutter and employees become disengaged.

            Fullbridge has invested over five years and millions of dollars building Lyra from a rich combination of learning experts and Industrial &amp; Organizational (“IO”) Psychologists. The Lyra Learning platform benefits from the deep discoveries of Fullbridge partner Aptima, Inc., a company that has done over $200 million of research and development for the US military, NASA, the Department of Health into human competency learning and measurement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lyra also benefits from the insights of our Chairman of Technology, Alex “Sandy” Pentland, a founder of the MIT Media Lab and author of Human Signals (2008) and Social Physics (2015).

            The new science of learning needed to be delivered in a whole new way.

          <h3>
            Transformational Learning
          </h3>
          <p>
            Lyra works because it seamlessly integrates just the right amount of online learning with in-person experiential exercises into a richly designed experience. Fullbridge has discovered this critical balance to successful learning that results in truly transformational experiences with incredible and measurable results. This new high-tech high-touch approach allows individuals to immediately implement and test newly acquired knowledge and skills with other team members to find solutions faster.
          </p>
          <p>
            9?% of Fullbridge participants report their experiences as “transformational”.

              <p>
                Individual skills information is translated into a Lyra SkillsPrint—giving participants specific and actionable feedback on how their knowledge and behaviors contribute to, or detract from, their ability to contribute effectively to problem solving. Lyra helps test key areas of performance including; business knowledge, concepts, and capacities such as planning, teamwork, and communications. Lyra successfully guides individuals to the learning that will have the greatest impact on improving the skills they need most to successfully contribute to their teams.

              <p>
                Management is constantly trying to understand why some teams or divisions succeed, while others struggle or fail. Lyra helps provide the key insights management needs to better understand what skills, capacities and behaviors drive success in their fields and then how to build those capacities that matter.
