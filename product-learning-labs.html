            <h3>What is a learning lab?</h3>
            <p>
              Lyra Learning Labs are scenario-based, in-person, team learning experiences that develop agile individual contributors and team idea flow. With a focus on learning by doing, our labs are experiential, fast-paced, and designed to measure and improve the competencies linked to innovation and improved team performance.

            <h3>Why does it work?</h3>
            <p>
              Learning labs recognize that there is no one right way to improve. They are designed to foster mindset shifts and lasting behavioral changes by focusing on the competencies that drive exploration, engagement, and idea flow. They present a problem-solving exercise, capture competency data, and deliver learning that matters to you.
