            <h3>What is a working lab?</h3>
            <p>
              Lyra Working Labs are follow-on experiences to our Learning Labs that facilitate ongoing performance growth and the effective integration of learning into day-to-day work. Working labs include three key components: high-fidelity scenarios, learning that is applicable to your organization&rsquo;s highest priorities, and data that informs and captures progress on lasting behavioral changes.

            <h3>Why does it work?</h3>
            <p>
              Whether in the Navy Seals or the corporate world, studies show that human competencies are not simply attained, but are the result of work and ongoing practice. Fullbridge understands this and has worked with scientists and designers to create working labs, a product that addresses the factors that drive real impact and results by integrating learning with on-the-job practice.

                Working labs are designed as partnerships in learning between Fullbridge and organizations committed to developing their employees and learning culture. The best results are achieved when Lyra Learning Labs are supported with long-term Working Labs to enable follow-up exercises and relevant opportunities for employees to apply new skills and methodologies to their actual work problems. Lyra integrates learning with work to help participants have the impact that drives daily innovation and problem solving in their worlds.
