                  Hierarchical organizational models aren&rsquo;t just being turned upside downâ€”they&rsquo;re being deconstructed from the inside out. Businesses are reinventing themselves to operate as networks of teams to keep pace with the challenges of a fluid, unpredictable world.

              Trainings on everything from communication to coding quickly become obsolete when new programs and data are released. To stay ahead of the curve of change, organizations must create learning cultures focused on agility, business objective alignment, and new ways of meeting daily challenges. Best practices quickly become outdated. Online videos don&rsquo;t build real capacity and knowledge. Our world of constant change has buried traditional training.

            <h3>Can You Learn to Innovate?</h3>
            <p>
              In 1985, Robert Kelley of Carnegie Mellon University conducted one of the seminal innovation studies by investigating why a small number of top performers drove most of the innovation at Bell Labs. Kelley found that the top performers were characterized by their diverse social networks and active pursuit of new ideas.

            <p>
              Kelley noted in his study of Bell Labs that educational backgrounds, IQ scores, and personality types were fairly evenly divided between the star performers and the rest of the population, leading him to believe that what we now call idea flow could be learned.

            <p>
              At Fullbridge, we take inspiration from the work of Robert Kelley and Bell Labs. We&rsquo;ve shown that the skills, habits, and behaviors of these star performers are learnable. And that the tools, measures, and learning methodologies available to us today can help us increase the rate of collaboration and thus innovation.

            Disruptive technologies continue to wreak havoc on organizations that fail to innovate and fall behind. Learning cultures create environments where Idea Flow happens&mdash;environments where daily problem-solving can occur resulting in higher performance and innovative ideas.
