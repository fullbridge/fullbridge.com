              <h3>Training Is Dead</h3>
              <p>
                Trainings on everything from communication to coding quickly become obsolete when new programs and data are released. To stay ahead of the curve of change, organizations must create learning cultures focused on agility, business objective alignment, and new ways of meeting daily challenges. Best practices quickly become outdated. Online videos don’t build real capacity and knowledge. Our world of constant change has buried traditional training.
