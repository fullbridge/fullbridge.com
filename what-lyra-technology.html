                Lyra is a knowledge technology hub that captures data from wearable devices, peer, self, and expert assessments, and creates personalized learning from an ever-expanding pool of educational content.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lyra processes multiple layers of data on underlying competencies to give participants a rich picture of their performance and a better understanding of how to develop the self-awareness, knowledge, skills, and strategies that drive daily problem-solving and innovation.

                Hierarchical organizational models aren&rsquo;t just being turned upside down—they&rsquo;re being deconstructed from the inside out. Businesses are reinventing themselves to operate as networks of teams to keep pace with the challenges of a fluid, unpredictable world.

            <h3>
              The Lyra SkillsPrint
            </h3>
            <p>
              Lyra translates data it collects into a SkillsPrint&mdash;giving participants specific and actionable feedback on how their knowledge and behaviors contribute to, or detract from, their ability to effectively contribute to problem-solving. Lyra helps evaluate key areas of performance including business knowledge, concepts, and capacities such as planning, teamwork, and communications. Lyra successfully guides individuals to the learning that will have the greatest impact on improving the skills they need most to successfully contribute to their teams.
            </p>
            <h3>Lyra Management Insights</h3>
            <p>
              Management is constantly trying to understand why some teams or divisions succeed, while others struggle or fail. Lyra helps provide the key insights management needs to better understand what skills, capacities and behaviors drive success in their fields and then how to build those capacities that matter.
            </p>
            <h3>Accessibility</h3>
            <p>
              When providing learning programs for employees, organizations must be mindful of federal regulations governing accessibility according to the guidelines of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Fullbridge in conformance with Level AA of the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 throughout our learning experiences, making our learning labs and modules a safe way for our partners to ensure that all employees are included and respected.

              <p>
                We have completely reimagined learning design by developing Lyra, an integrated approach to adaptability, agility, and problem-solving. Fullbridge has invested over five years and millions of dollars building Lyra from a rich combination of learning experts and Industrial and Organizational (&ldquo;IO&rdquo;) psychologists. The Lyra technology benefits from the deep discoveries of Fullbridge partners such as Aptima, Inc., a company that has invested $200 million in researching and developing competency definitions, assessments, and trainings for the U.S. military, NASA, and the Department of Health. The new science of learning needed to be delivered in a whole new way.

              <h3>Transformational Learning</h3>
              <p>
                Lyra works because it integrates the right amount of online learning and in-person exercises to create a richly designed experience. Fullbridge has discovered this critical balance essential to learning that results in truly transformational experiences with incredible and measurable results. This new high-tech, high-touch approach allows individuals to immediately implement and test newly acquired knowledge and skills with other team members to find solutions faster.

                <strong>Did you know?</strong> <em>90% of Fullbridge alumni report that Fullbridge programs either “met fully” or “exceeded” their expectations.</em>
