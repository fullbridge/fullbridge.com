                Lyra is a knowledge technology hub that captures data from wearable devices, peer, self, and expert assessments, and creates personalized learning from an ever-expanding pool of educational content.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lyra processes multiple layers of data on underlying competencies to give participants a rich picture of their performance and a better understanding of how to develop the self-awareness, knowledge, skills, and strategies that drive daily problem-solving and innovation.

                Hierarchical organizational models aren&rsquo;t just being turned upside down—they&rsquo;re being deconstructed from the inside out. Businesses are reinventing themselves to operate as networks of teams to keep pace with the challenges of a fluid, unpredictable world.

                  Did you know?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  An MIT study found that by measuring human signals such as fluidity, confidence, and tone (without listening to the content of what was being said) they could accurately predict which plans executives would select in a business plan contest and what dates women would choose in a speed dating exercise.

                  Don&rsquo;t lose opportunities to solve important problems and find new innovative solutions because the best ideas get lost in the clutter and employees become disengaged. At Fullbridge, we use sociometric and assessment data to help individuals and teams discover how to have their ideas heard and contribute more effectively by solving problems that matter.

              The Lyra SkillsPrint
            </h3>
            <p>
              Individual skills information is translated into a Lyra SkillsPrint—giving participants specific and actionable feedback on how their knowledge and behaviors contribute to, or detract from, their ability to contribute effectively to problem solving. Lyra helps test key areas of performance including; business knowledge, concepts, and capacities such as planning, teamwork, and communications. Lyra successfully guides individuals to the learning that will have the greatest impact on improving the skills they need most to successfully contribute to their teams.

            <h3>Lyra Management Insights</h3>
            <p>
              Management is constantly trying to understand why some teams or divisions succeed, while others struggle or fail. Lyra helps provide the key insights management needs to better understand what skills, capacities and behaviors drive success in their fields and then how to build those capacities that matter.

              <p>
                We have completely reimagined learning design by developing Lyra, an integrated approach to adaptability, agility, and problem-solving. Fullbridge has invested over five years and millions of dollars building Lyra from a rich combination of learning experts and Industrial and Organizational (&ldquo;IO&rdquo;) psychologists. The Lyra technology benefits from the deep discoveries of Fullbridge partners like Aptima, Inc. and Sandy Pentland, a founder of the MIT Media Lab. The new science of learning needed to be delivered in a whole new way.

              <h3>Transformational Learning</h3>
              <p>
                Lyra works because it integrates the right amount of online learning and in-person exercises to create a richly designed experience. Fullbridge has discovered this critical balance essential to learning that results in truly transformational experiences with incredible and measurable results. This new high-tech, high-touch approach allows individuals to immediately implement and test newly acquired knowledge and skills with other team members to find solutions faster.
