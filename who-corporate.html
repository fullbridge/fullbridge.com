              Fullbridge helps corporations increase daily innovation and problem solving to drive everything from product development to sales. People today have more access to information and knowledge than ever before yet they often lack the capacity to find and focus on the right ideas.

            <h3>Fullbridge learning experiences help corporations:</h3>
            <ol class="landing-numbered-list">
              <li>Generate a learning culture</li>
              <li>Work more effectively in teams</li>
              <li>Engage in solving the problems that matter</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              <strong>Did you know?</strong> Support for innovation (e.g., being open to change, valuing new ideas), vision, task orientation, and external communication displayed the strongest relationships with creativity and innovation in teams (Hulsheger et al., 2009).

                    I have noticed that when we have open positions, managers will call and say, &lsquo;who went through the Fullbridge Program? I want to think about them first.&rsquo; We&rsquo;ve had two or three people who&rsquo;ve moved into new positions since the program ended.

              <p>
                While it took 50 years for the telephone to reach approximately 75 million American homes, and 38 years for the radio to reach 38 million listeners, it took <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IAIZAPI/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1" target="_blank" class="link">only 5 years</a> for Facebook to reach 600 million people.

              <h3>Employee Engagement</h3>
              <p>
              21% of millennials say they've changed jobs within the past year, which is more than three times the number of non-millennials who report the same. What does this turnover cost us? About <a href="http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/191459/millennials-job-hopping-generation.aspx" target="_blank" class="link">$30.5 billion</a> annually.

              <h3>Inconsistent Teamwork</h3>
              <p>
                A pattern of oscillating between exploration and engagement accounts for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Social-Physics-Networks-Make-Smarter/dp/0143126334" target="_blank" class="link">more than half</a> of the difference in creative output for research groups.
