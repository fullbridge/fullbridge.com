              Fullbridge helps law firms become better trusted business advisers. Successful lawyers need more than knowledge of the law. Great lawyers identify and solve problems by engaging with clients and teams. This engagement requires a nuanced understanding of business, insights into negotiation, and design thinking to frame solutions. Lyra helps lawyers develop key business knowledge and core competencies that drive better teamwork, client relationships, and negotiation skills.
